# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) Automation Tool is a lightweight web application designed to help development teams track and manage security practices throughout their software development process. The tool provides a simple dashboard to monitor security checkpoints, generate basic reports, and maintain compliance documentation in a streamlined manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to track security checkpoints across different project phases, so that I can ensure our team follows secure development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all active projects with their current security status
2. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL initialize default security checkpoints for each SDLC phase
3. WHEN a user marks a security checkpoint as complete THEN the system SHALL update the project status and timestamp the completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to generate simple compliance reports, so that I can demonstrate our security practices to stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a project report THEN the system SHALL generate a PDF showing completed security checkpoints and their completion dates
2. WHEN generating a report THEN the system SHALL include project name, phase completion status, and overall security score
3. IF a project has incomplete security checkpoints THEN the report SHALL highlight missing items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and update security task checklists, so that I can complete required security activities for my assigned phase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a project phase THEN the system SHALL display relevant security tasks as a checklist
2. WHEN a user checks off a security task THEN the system SHALL save the completion status immediately
3. WHEN all tasks in a phase are complete THEN the system SHALL automatically mark that phase as completed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to add notes and evidence for completed security tasks, so that we can maintain proper documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a security task THEN the system SHALL allow adding optional notes and file attachments
2. WHEN evidence is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store files securely and associate them with the specific task
3. WHEN viewing completed tasks THEN the system SHALL display associated notes and allow downloading evidence files
